            Tinea is also known as ringworms. This is because it can cause red patches on the skin in th shape of
            rings. But it's not caused by worms. It's caused by different types of fungi. Tinea infections of the feet,
            nails and genital area are not often called ringworms. This is because the red patches may not look like 
            rings. The fungus that causes tinea is very common all over the world, including the U.S. It's very contagious.
            The fungus is spread through direct contact with:

        <p id="points">
            (i) An infected person.<br>

            (iii) An infected animal.<br>
            (iv) Infected soil.<br>
            It can take days or upto 2 weeks before you develop the infection after being in contact with the fungus.
            The fungi that cause ringworm can live for a long time on objects. Because of this, you may not know 
            the exact source.
